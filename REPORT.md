# CST276SRS02  

Date Validation Strategy/Template Method  

Name: Mark Hultin  

---
Issues: Failed to meet deadline for the Polygon, Rectangle, and Composite classes (there is no GoF Composite in the CompositeFactory project). Loading and Storing of JSON files is not implemented.


Notes:  This was a fun project. The Modern C++ Design section on the Factory Method was clear and easy to follow. A single ShapeFactory, as a Singleton, was implemented.
